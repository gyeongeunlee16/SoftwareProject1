Note:
We watched the tutorial about live currency converter and followed the basic structure but modified a significant portion of codes such as, renaming the currency  and enabling two-way conversions from one currency to another (and vice versa).
We wrote the length, weight, and temperature conversions by ourselves based on the tutorial and swift explanations online.

Instructions to run the files
1. Open RealAwesomeConverter.xcodeproj / AwesomeConverter.xcodeproj in macbook with xcode software installed in it
2. Press the play button and allow the simulator to run.

Note for running AwesomeConverter.xcodeproj:

3. Put the amount you would like to convert in the text box on the top.
4. Choose "To" and "From" units you would like to convert.
5. Press "convert" and the result will show at the bottom of the screen.
